This web project features a front end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by a MySQL database. It supports three user types: Farmers, Field Officers, and Admin. Farmers can create user accounts and send queries to field officers. Field officers are able to respond to these queries, facilitating effective communication. Admins have the authority to Insert, Delete, View or Update the accounts of both farmers and field officers, ensuring proper management and oversight. This system is designed to enhance the efficiency and coordination among different user roles, streamlining interactions and administrative tasks within the platform.
